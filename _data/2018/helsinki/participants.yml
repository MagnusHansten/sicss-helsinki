  bio: "Marta Kołczyńska received her Ph.D. in sociology from The Ohio State University in 2017 and now is a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.
  Her research examines the causes and consequences of political attitudes and behavior, in particular the effects of educational stratification of these attitudes and behaviors on democracy, in cross-national perspective.
  She is also exploring the opportunities of ex-post harmonization of cross-national survey data."

  bio: "Arpita Biswas is a Google PhD Fellow at the Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science.
  Her broad areas of interests include Algorithmic Game Theory, Machine Learning and Optimization.
  She is presently looking at problems in Computational Social Choice Theory and Fairness in Machine Learning.
  In Computational Social Choice Theory, she is working on the existence and hardness of various fairness notions while partitioning indivisible goods among agents.
  She has prior experience in multi-agent learning (multi-armed bandit), incentive mechanisms, facility location, planning and scheduling etc.
  and thus far she has worked on problems arising from real-world scenarios like online crowd-sourcing, resource allocation, dynamic pricing in transportation etc."

  bio: "Anders Grundtvig is a Master student at Aalborg University where he study Techno-Anthropology. His field of interest is STS
  (Science and Technology Studies) where he uses digital methods to map and understand human behaviour and social interactions.
  His educational backbone builds on physical fieldworking and theories about interdisciplinarity and user-driven research. This
  backbone has reseantly been combined with digital methods that opens new forms of investigation where the quali-quanti is
  mixed together with digital-analouge research oppunities.
  He has reseantly been working on the project 'A Field Guide to fake news' that investigated how we can understand the ecosystems
  of fake news rather than just debunking them when found. And is now working on a project about personal digital data and trust
  (or lack therof). "

-name: Magnus Hanstén
image: /2018/helsinki/images/Magnus Hansten.jpg
bio: "Magnus Hanstén is a MSc student at the University of Helsinki where he study environmental sciences. His research interests 
include the field of marine resource management and marine spatial planning, fields which combine both the management of human behaviour 
and the environmental aspects. He is a firm believer in interdisciplinarity when it comes to developing systems where humans and 
nature can coexist in a sustainable manner.
He is currently working on a study regarding the social dimensions of a fisheries management system called individual transferable 
quotas (ITQ). Social sciences have in the last decade become an important part of fisheries management, which today balances economic, 
social and environmental values in the pursuit of sustainable fishery practices. His study will consist of a comparison between Finland, 
Sweden and Denmark, which all are using ITQs for managing their fisheries."
